Since the location search is temporarily unavailable, I'll provide some general recommendations focusing on outdoor activities and adventure, keeping your medium budget and hotel preference in mind. Let's dive in!\n\n**General Tips for Tokyo**\n\n*   **Transportation:** Tokyo has an amazing public transportation system. Consider getting a Suica or Pasmo card for easy travel on trains and buses. A Japan Rail Pass might be worth it if you plan on doing a lot of intercity travel beyond Tokyo.\n*   **Pocket Wifi/SIM Card:** Staying connected is super helpful. Rent a pocket wifi or get a local SIM card at the airport.\n*   **Cash:** While many places accept credit cards, it's always good to have some cash on hand, especially for smaller shops and restaurants.\n*   **Language:** While many people in tourist areas speak some English, learning a few basic Japanese phrases can go a long way!\n\n**Day 1: Urban Adventures and Heights**\n\n*   **Morning (9:00 AM):** Explore **Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden**. This beautiful garden offers a peaceful escape from the city bustle. Wander through its different garden styles (English Landscape, French Formal, and Japanese Traditional). *Cost: Entry fee around ¥500 per person. Travel time to the garden depends on where you're staying, but Shinjuku is a major hub, so it's easily accessible.*\n*   **Late Morning/Lunch (11:30 AM):** Head to the **Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building** in Shinjuku.

Take a walk down Takeshita Street, known for its colorful fashion, quirky shops, and delicious street food.\n*   **Late Afternoon (4:00 PM):** Immerse yourself in the serene atmosphere of the **Meiji Jingu Shrine**, a peaceful oasis dedicated to Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken. It's a great place to experience traditional Japanese culture.\n*   **Evening (6:30 PM):** Dinner in **Shibuya**. This vibrant district is famous for its iconic scramble crossing. Find a restaurant with a view of the crossing for a memorable dining experience. There are tons of mid-range restaurants in Shibuya offering everything from ramen to sushi. *Dinner budget: ¥2,000-¥3,500 per person.*\n\n**Day 2: Nature Escape and Cultural Immersion**\n\n*   **Morning (9:00 AM):** Day trip to **Mount Takao**. This mountain offers a fantastic hiking experience with beautiful natural scenery. You can hike to the summit or take a cable car/chairlift part of the way up. *Travel time from central Tokyo: around 1 hour by train. Round-trip train fare: approx. ¥1,000-¥1,500.

Enjoy a delicious meal at one of the many restaurants in the area, offering everything from traditional Japanese cuisine to international flavors. *Dinner budget: ¥2,000-¥3,500 per person.*\n\n**Accommodation:**\n\nSince you prefer hotels and have a medium budget, look for hotels in areas like Shinjuku, Shibuya, or Ueno. You can find well-rated 3-4 star hotels in these areas. I recommend checking out sites like Booking.com or Agoda for deals.\n\n**Budget Estimate (per person for 2 days):**\n\n*   Accommodation: ¥10,000 - ¥20,000 (for 2 nights)\n*   Transportation: ¥3,000 - ¥5,000\n*   Food: ¥8,000 - ¥12,000\n*   Activities/Entrance Fees: ¥2,000 - ¥4,000\n*   **Total: ¥23,000 - ¥41,000** (This is a rough estimate and can vary depending on your choices.)\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   These are just suggestions, and you can customize the itinerary to fit your interests and preferences.\n*   Check the opening hours and admission fees for attractions in advance.\n*   Book accommodations and transportation in advance, especially if you're traveling during peak season.\n\nHave an amazing adventure in Tokyo!\n",
